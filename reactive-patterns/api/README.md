# Mock Api for Intro To Angular Workshop

This sample application will make an http request to fetch data. To allow us to practice using the Angular HttpClient, we will be using Mockoon to quickly spin up the endpoints our application will be requesting.

## Download Mockoon

Follow the installation instructions on this website:
https://mockoon.com

We are using Mockoon to quickly spinup and mock a response for the products in our workshop application.

If you are not comfortable using this application we can alternatively hardcode the response.

## Starting the endpoint

To setup and start the server, select `open environment` from the `file` menu. 
Select `IntroToAngularApi.json` as the environment.
Click the littler green arrow on the top left hand side of the header or select `Start/Stop/Reload Current Environment` from the `run` menu.

At this point the endpoint should be running an accepting requests.
